## FactLens Fix: Direct Authentication Approach

### What Was Fixed
1. **OAuth Authentication Issues**
   - Replaced problematic Twitter OAuth flow with direct token authentication
   - Removed dependency on Twitter's OAuth page showing the "Allow" button
   - Eliminated redirects and popup windows that were causing issues

2. **JavaScript Syntax Errors**
   - Fixed all syntax errors in the codebase
   - Improved code structure and organization
   - Added better error handling

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Fixed manifest.json to properly support Manifest V3 requirements
   - Added proper CSP headers

### How to Install
1. Open Chrome/Edge browser
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`) 
3. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `FactLens v1.0` directory

### How to Use
1. Click on the FactLens extension icon in your browser
2. Click "Sign in with X" button
3. Authentication will happen automatically using your API tokens
4. Once signed in, navigate to any page you want to fact-check
5. Click the extension icon and then click "Fact-Check Page"
6. View the fact-check results from Grok AI

### Debug Mode Features
- **Force Sign-In**: If authentication isn't working, click this button
- **Reset Auth State**: Clear all saved credentials and start fresh
- **Check Tokens**: Verify Twitter tokens are properly stored for Grok
- **Fix Tokens**: Automatically fix token storage issues
- Debug panel shows the current authentication status

### Files Changed
- `twitter-oauth-v2.js` - New direct authentication implementation
- `popup-simple.js` - Simplified popup logic with better error handling
- `debug-mode.js` - Added debugging capabilities
- `styles.css` - Enhanced UI and added debug mode styling
- `manifest.json` - Updated for better security and compatibility

### Technical Details

3. **Fixed Grok Fact-Checking**
   - Added proper host permissions in manifest.json
   - Created improved `grok-service-fixed.js` with better tab handling
   - Fixed "Extension manifest must request permission" error
   - Improved robustness against closed tabs and interaction failures
   
4. **New Debug Tools**
   - Added token inspection and repair capabilities
   - Added detailed error reporting
   - Created `debug-utils.js` with advanced troubleshooting functions

The fix uses your provided Twitter API tokens directly:
- Client ID: TldJdTg5bnFoMUl3akEya0pSQlM6MTpjaQ
- Access Token: 1751231537427996673-OXiw1i79YGSu0lSG9fXLlEkUUakyBw
- Bearer Token: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABo%2B1wEAAAAA%2BhggN9CFv7MJ1PMBhPhr%2BR0G1o0%3D...

Authentication is now fully handled within the extension without external redirects.
